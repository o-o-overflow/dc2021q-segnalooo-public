# Test scripts are heavily encouraged.
# All scripts should exit 0 if nothing went wrong.
# Scripts are automatically determined to be exploit scripts if they start with the word "exploit".
# Exploit scripts must output the flag using "FLAG: <FLAG>" and exit with 0 if the flag was captured correctly.
